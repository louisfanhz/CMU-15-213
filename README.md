# CMU-15-213

Lab Assignments for CMU 15-213: Introduction to Computer Systems. All labs are completed except for lab 7. The course description is quoted from
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/:

The ICS course provides a programmer's view of how computer systems execute programs, store information, and communicate. It enables students to 
become more effective programmers, especially in dealing with issues of performance, portability and robustness. It also serves as a foundation 
for courses on compilers, networks, operating systems, and computer architecture, where a deeper understanding of systems-level issues is required. 
Topics covered include: machine-level code and its generation by optimizing compilers, performance evaluation and optimization, computer arithmetic, 
memory organization and management, networking technology and protocols, and supporting concurrent computation.
